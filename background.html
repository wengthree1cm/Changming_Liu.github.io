  <h2>Background</h2>

  <p>
    I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Health Data Science, where I combine machine learning and statistical modeling with biomedical data to uncover actionable insights. My academic foundation was built at UCSD, where I worked on neuroscience-related image processing and predictive modeling using Python, OpenCV, and MATLAB.
  </p>

  <p>
    Professionally, I’ve gained hands-on experience across both life sciences and financial analytics. At CNPC USA and BCG, I developed scalable ETL and NLP pipelines to accelerate data workflows for large genomic and geospatial datasets, while improving model interpretability and deployment efficiency. My work spans from deploying LLM-powered dashboards for CRISPR simulations to automating investor report generation using Python, SQL, and visualization tools. Earlier at CITIC Securities, I leveraged regression and Monte Carlo simulations to analyze fund risks, and implemented automated pipelines for parsing market news and macroeconomic data.
  </p>

  <p>
    Across every role, I’ve sought to bridge data science with high-impact domains—whether that means delivering real-time dashboards in biotech, optimizing prediction models for customer churn, or enhancing infrastructure with FastAPI and cloud platforms like AWS.
